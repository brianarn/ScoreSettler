# ScoreSettler

ScoreSettler is a simple little experiment, a proof-of-concept, built to help me clear my mind a bit.

The general concept is that it's a means of keeping track of dice rolls in Settlers of Catan (or in any 2d6-based game). It always seems like 5, 6, 8, or 9 are hot, where 7 doesn't pop *as* often as one might expect. I've been wanting to make this for awhile, and finally took a moment to get the damn thing out of my head.

So, here you go. MIT License, which means you can do what you want with it, though (while it's totally allowed by the license) I'd ask that you not incorporate it in a for-sale application - as though someone would do that. :P
