				<p>This is a proof-of-concept of a simple utility, designed at keeping track of score averages in Settlers of Catan.</p>
				<p>You see, as my friends and I play, it often seems that 6 or 8 winds up coming out on top, whereas statistically, 7 should be the most common. If I ever finish this thing, I'll be able to use it during a game to keep track of dice averages, which I find kind of exciting.</p>
				<p>To use it (if it's not obvious): Click or tap the value that was rolled. It'll then show some stats and update the graph.</p>
				<p>I've also built in some simulation:</p>
				Roll interval (in milliseconds):<input id="simInterval" type="number" value="500">
				<button id="sim">Simulate Rolls</button>
